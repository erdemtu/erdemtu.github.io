I started tinkering with the blog to customize it a bit to my tastes. It has
been very simple so far but I didn't try anything out of the ordinary anyway.

The default sass files has been simple enough for customizing fonts and colors.
Adding excerpts of posts to the main page has been very simple as well, I guess I
shouldn't find it very surprising since it is a very common UI pattern. Actually
I am a little surprised that excerpts are not shown by default but I have no
complaints.

I am thinking of looking into stuff like automating common tasks like creating a
new post. I am sure that somebody has already created a rakefile for that.
