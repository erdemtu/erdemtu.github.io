So I decided to rebuild my website. Rebuild is probably not the right word, the
site is simply a Jekyll blog. It does its job well but I want a little more than
that. Its looks okay but it could use some work.

As of writing this post, the site looks like this:
![erdemtu.com as of 2016 December]({{ site.url }}/assets/erdemtu_2016.png)

Before deciding on the functionality, it is best to list what purposes the
website should fulfill.

**Blogging.** The website should serve my blog posts & allow me to add new posts
very easily. Also it should preserve the current content.

**Portfolio.** The website should show my previous projects & designs. It should
give a good idea about my experience and the type of work that I am capable of
doing.

**Showing Off.** The website should look good and leave a good impression.

**Exercise.** I want to learn more about building websites. It should help me
working alongside web & backend developers. Also it would be nice to be able to
build a backend for an app. The website should provide me the opportunity to
learn these.

On my next blog post, I'll write about the functionality.
