I finally released [Tablecloth](https://github.com/erdemtu/Tablecloth)
on Github and CocoaPods. Sure,
[other similar solutions](http://erdemtu.com/2015/10/24/handling-uitableview-objects.html)
has popped up, ever since I wrote the very first version of it in Objective-C.
At this point it was a matter of principle.

Hey, I even made a logo for it:

It is written in Swift 3 and for now not that accessible, but I'll improve
on the architecture and the documentation. Before I do, I plan to take a look at
some Functional Reactive stuff (namely RXSwift and ReactiveCocoa).
I have been meaning to try FRP for sometime and I imagine it could help with
improving Tablecloth.
