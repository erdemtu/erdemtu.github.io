We've finally released [Matte AR, an AR app for showcasing Matte Studio's works.](http://matte-studio.com/ar/)
. This picture should be a good summary of the
app's functionality:

By the way our first game is already underway. Title pending:

It should be complete when we implement the UI, the sounds and a couple of gameplay
features. We decided to make our first game very simple. Hopefully it will be out
very soon.
