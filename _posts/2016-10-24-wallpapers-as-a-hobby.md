I have this hobby of making wallpapers for phones. Here is the first one I ever made:

I had gotten tired of whatever wallpaper I used back then and I wanted to have something that was full of energy. It did give me a burst of energy as well, so I made a habit of changing wallpapers.

I guess, not looking at the same picture everyday makes a bit of a difference. Crafting something that is only for own judgement can be a nice change of pace as well. I have to add that I use pieces by other people as well. Sometimes they are too good to pass up:

By the way, here is the latest one I made. Inspired by Samurai Champloo:
