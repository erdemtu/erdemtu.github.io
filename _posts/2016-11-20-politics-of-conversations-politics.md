I find it hard to talk about politics with strangers. Especially online. You
never know what to expect in terms of political leanings and more importantly
temperament.

I am more timid than the average person but I suppose most people are similar.
We make small talk with new acquaintances for a good reason. After we have
gotten more familiar with someone, it becomes harder for us to paint them
whole by what they believe.

For a while though, things work differently. Many people are routinely
outraged by whatever disaster is the latest news. We are in a constant state of
gloom.

Not to say there is nothing to be outraged about. But we are
often doing it in a way that only increases the distance with people we
disagree with. We don't give people the space to change their minds. If our
message is that "you are a fool to believe X", we just give people incentive to
prove that they are not fools.

We also don't give ourselves to change our minds. It is good to have convictions
but to believe and act as if that we can only be in the right, is a recipe for a
flame war, not healthy debate. And that is exactly what has been happening. We
are a lot like supporters of sports clubs. Any judgment we make is being colored
by what team we are fans of.

The result is that we are so caught up in defending our teams from naysayers
that we don't sincerely criticize them and often bend the truth in their favor.

Most news sources are not helping either. What facts we are getting is wildly
different, depending on our preexisting beliefs. We consider sources that agrees
with our preexisting beliefs, to be accurate. It is more profitable and safe for
media to preach to the choir. Governments and other authorities encourage this
as well by supporting those who agree with them and suppressing their
dissenters.

And so the polarization marches on.

I have to add that not every word uttered is worthy of debate. There *are*
people who claim the irrational, due to ignorance or malice. This makes it even
harder to stay on topic and sift the truth. I sincerely don't know how to
dismiss utter nonsense and be diplomatic about it.

I feel that this is not really a brand new development. Society probably has
this cycle of weaving between extremes of intolerance and apathy. I just wish
that we could arrive at a better place soon without learning our lesson the hard
way.

Wishing doesn't solve anything though. For now, I'll start by putting forth
my convictions without alienating others. This post has been an attempt at this.
