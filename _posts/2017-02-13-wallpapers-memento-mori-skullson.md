As usual, I got bored of my wallpaper phone. So I made two.

The first one was supposed to be a skull with a viking helmet. After using it
for a couple of days, I decided that the helmet wasn't that great. Maybe I'll
try it that way someday, but not very likely.

This one came up as a result of trying to come up with some decorations for the
skull. Probably the skull is not necessary at all, maybe I'll drop that as well.
skull.
