The shifts in what we consider "acceptable" or "common sense" are interesting.
Smoking in airplanes are a good example. While watching Mad Men you get used to
people smoking constantly but the that time half the passengers lit up their
cigarettes is surprising.

I wonder about the commonplace things today that we'll find barbaric in the
future. Here is some of my guesses:

**Traffic by Human-operated Cars.** I think it is a bit insane how normal
it is to own and drive so powerful vehicles. The transition to self driving cars will be interesting.

**Smoking.** E-cigarettes and similar stuff could take the torch though

**40-hour week.** As more & more things get automated, it doesn't seem as necessary to devote this much portion of our lives to work. [It might even be necessary not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU).
