While going through the Game Developer Conference back catalog, I came across [this wonderful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miwrDpbb25Q) titled "Everything I Said Was Wrong: Why Indie Is Different Now". Basically it is a bunch of game developers reflecting on the advice they have given over the years.

The last talk by Rami Ä°smail especially resonated with me. Way back when I was
in University there was seminars by successful people in the industry about
their path to success. Although I respected their achievements and valued their
experiences, I was skeptical about the usefulness of their advice due to the
fact that we don't get to hear from the people who went to similar paths with
less success.

This is not to say nobody should give any advice whatsoever. Just that their
experiences are more useful and we should try to add context to any advice we
give or receive.

All around good talk. It is an hour long but I appreciated all of the speakers
perspectives.
