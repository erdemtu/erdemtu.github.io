I couldn't come up with something worth writing about this week. I haven't been
that strict about the blogging habit so rather than let another week go by, I
decided to share a couple of iPhone wallpapers that I made.

I also included dark versions. They look better on home screens.

This one is inspired by [From the New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_New_World_(novel))

This one is a reiteration of something I made, way back in 2012. I am a bit iffy
about the color but it is better to make first & edit later.
