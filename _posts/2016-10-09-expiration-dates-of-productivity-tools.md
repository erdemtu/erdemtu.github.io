Every so often I get fed up with whatever note taking, habit tracking, to do
list tool that I am using. I used to think it was about the feature
set.

It is like how ringtones get tiresome after a
while. No matter how beautiful the piece you picked, hearing it hundreds
of times makes it not that different from
[a stereotypical alarm sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV-JJGeQfJE).
In fact, it is worse when you pick a song that you like; it becomes a trigger
for mild dread.

Even little changes can help. [Clear](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154?mt=8)
for example, have color themes. While the novelty didn't last, switching colors
did help extend the expiration date.

Maybe I should build my own to-do list app. One that changes its appearance
on its own. Maybe randomly, maybe according to seasons. Maybe a mixture of both.
Could be worth a try.
