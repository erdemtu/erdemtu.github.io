Recently I enjoyed watching [this old GDC talk titled Hearts & Minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrO5IGoPgcw) by game designer Frank Lantz.
While watching another talk, it popped into my mind again so I felt like I had to share & keep a note of it. 

The talk is like a mini version of [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)
in the context of video games. Frank Lantz explores & questions the schisms between the rational & the emotional. I found his argument that "Games are the Aesthetic Form of Instrumental Reason" to be pretty interesting.

While the talk is very light on direct, practical advice for making stuff, it is the type
of talk that helps you think things throught & develop a new perspective on things. This
might not be your cup of tea; either way I recommend it.
